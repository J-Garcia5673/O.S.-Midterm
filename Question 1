1.	For each of the following process state transition, say whether the 
transition is legal and how the transition occurs or why it cannot.
    a.	Change from thread state WAIT to thread state RUNNING 
        i.	This transition is illegal because a process in the WAIT/BLOCKED
         state must go through the READY state before it can run. It cannot 
         be schedules from a blocked state to a running state directly. 
    b.	Change from thread state RUNNING to thread state WAIT
        i.	This is a legal transition. When a RUNNING process initiates I/O 
        or any other blocking operation, it then becomes a state of BLOCKED/WAIT.  
    c.	Change from thread state READY to thread state WAIT
        i.	This is an illegal transition, because a process must go from READY 
        to RUNNING, but it cannot go back to WAIT/BLOCKED until it is scheduled and executed.
