4.	Consider the following piece of C code: 
void main ( ) { 
fork ( ); 
fork ( );
 exit ( ); 
} 
How many child processes are created upon execution of this program?

There will be four new processes created from the two forks. Two of them 
will be parents and the other two would be the children, each pair containing 
one of each.
